# Exercise 3.10

I further optimized the production Dockerfile for my personal website by switching to alpine based image for the runner. The production dockerfile was already pretty well organized, using multi stage builds and running as a non root user, so there was not a lot to change.

By switching to alpine based python image, the filesize went down from 260MB~ to 130MB~
